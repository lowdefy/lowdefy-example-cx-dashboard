      <p>NLS is used to measure the net loyalty of customers after an interaction with the company. It ignores customers who were neither 'very happy / unhappy', to establish what percentage of customers are now more loyal to the brand (Promoters) vs those who are now less loyal (Detractors / At Risk).</p>
      
      <p>Calculated from the loyalty questions (Q12, Q13, Q14):<br/>
      <strong style="color: #006100;">Loyal</strong> (Promoters): Number who scored 9+ on <strong>all</strong> loyalty questions,<br/>
      <strong>minus</strong><br/>
      <strong style="color: #a10000;">At Risk</strong> (Detractors): Number who scored less than 6 for <strong>any</strong> of the loyalty questions
      as percentage of sample who answered loyalty questions.</p>
      <strong>Example: </strong><br/>
      <strong style="color: #006100;">25 Loyal</strong> customers <em>minus</em> <strong style="color: #a10000;">10 At Risk</strong><span style="color: #a10000;"> </span>customers of <strong>50 Sample</strong><br/>
      = 15 / 50<br/>
      = 30% NPS
